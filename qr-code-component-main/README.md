## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

Learned how to use design file as a guideline to efficiently creating a funtioning webpage. Also learned more CSS properties, functionalities as well relevant properties


```css
.container{
    background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius:24px;
    width: 320px;
    padding: 16px 16px 40px 16px;
    margin:auto;
    float: center;
  
}
```


### Continued development
A couple areas I'd want to work on if making my webpage that is adaptable to any screen size without compromising on structure and design. I also want to work on using containers more in my code.


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This helped me in creating a properly aligned contatainer. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
